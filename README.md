Hello! Thanks for checking out this repository! I hope you liked it. Checkout the end result [here](https://GoodBoyNeon.github.io/rng). I did this as an practice project to get started with React and Typescript. So this might not be a perfect repository, (I doubt even if it's a good one or not) so if you see any fields of improvements, please let me know! I'd love getting your feedbacks or tips!
